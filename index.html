            <p> Charlee was adopted from Hangzhou, China when she was 10 months old. She grew up in Lynbrook, New York.
                She graduated from Brandeis University Cum Laude with a B.A. in Psychology and Music. She gained some
                experience in Python by working in the Neurochemistry and Cognition Lab at Brandeis University. After
                leaving the lab, she enrolled as a full time student in
                The Georgia Institute of Technology's Full Stack Coding BootCamp to further her skills.
                In her spare time she enjoys experimenting in the kitchen and playing the flute.
