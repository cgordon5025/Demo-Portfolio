            <div class="Vert-Line"></div>
            <p> Charlee was adopted from Hangzhou, China when she was 10 months old. She grew up in Lynbrook, New York.
                She graduated from Brandeis University Cum Laude with a B.A. in Psychology and Music. She gained some
                experience in Python by working in the Neurochemistry and Cognition Lab at Brandeis University. There
                she developed the group's behavioral tests using PsychoPy; these tests were both used in-person and
                pushed online thorugh GitHub and Pavlovia. After leaving the lab, she enrolled as a full time student in
                The Georgia Institute of Technology's Full Stack Coding BootCamp to further her skills.
                In her spare time she enjoys experimenting in the kitchen and playing the flute. While she works, she
                listens to Animal Crossing Music to get her through the day.
