# Demo-Portfolio

## Description
This is a demo portfolio, to be used as a practice while I develop my portfolio, and learn about CSS styling and HTML.

## Instalation
N/A

## Usage
Due to the page missing a JavaScript, it is mostly cosemetic. The navigation bar at the top does function and bring you to the appropriate sections, and the contact information does function as well.

All icons in the work section will ideally lead you to the relevant webpage to view the project. For now all links for the icons labelled TBA will lead to the same Animal Crossing Project. As I continue making pages, I will update this.
